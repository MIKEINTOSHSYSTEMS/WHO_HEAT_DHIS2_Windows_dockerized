                        measures to use for a full dataset based on
                        dimensions
HEAT_choose_measures_strata
                        A function to identify which inequality
                        measures to use for a strata
HEAT_create_input_list
                        Create list of inputs
HEAT_measures_full_process
                        Apply validation tests and compute inequality
                        measures in one step

HEAT_measures_outlier2NA
                        Set outlying inequality measures to NA
HEAT_measures_validation_map
                        Applies validation tests to a set of strata
HEAT_measures_validation_tests
                        Map the validation tests for inequality
                        measures to a strata
add_strata_id           Add a new column called 'strata_id' that will
                        be unique for each strata. The default fields
                        used to determine unique strata are created in
                        the data-raw/strata-variables.R file and are a
                        variable called HEAT_strata_variables
